# Customization

## Setup

Prerequisites: 

- Python (>=3.9)
- NodeJS (v14 or later)
- Docker

> if you are using ARM CPU like Apple M1 chip, please run `export DOCKER_DEFAULT_PLATFORM=linux/amd64` for building amd64 container image.

Clone the repository and make desired code changes.

```
git clone aws-solutions/centralized-logging-with-opensearch
```

## Unit Test

Run unit tests to make sure added customization passes the tests.

```
cd ./source
chmod +x ./run-all-tests.sh
./run-all-tests.sh
cd ..
```

Ensure all unit tests pass. Review the generated coverage report.

## Build

To build your customized distributable follow given steps.

- Configure the solution name, version number and bucket name

```
export DIST_OUTPUT_BUCKET=my-bucket-name # bucket where customized code will reside
export TEMPLATE_OUTPUT_BUCKET=my-bucket-name # same as DIST_OUTPUT_BUCKET
export SOLUTION_NAME=my-solution-name
export SOLUTION_TRADEMARKEDNAME=my-solution-name # same as SOLUTION_NAME
export VERSION=my-version # version number for the customized code
export REGION=aws-region-code # the AWS region to launch the solution (e.g. us-east-1)
```

_Note:_ You would have to create an S3 bucket with the prefix 'my-bucket-name-<aws_region>'; aws_region is where you are testing the customized solution. Also, the assets in bucket should be publicly accessible.

- Build the distributable using build-s3-dist.sh

```
cd ./deployment
chmod +x ./build-s3-dist.sh
./build-s3-dist.sh $DIST_OUTPUT_BUCKET $SOLUTION_NAME $VERSION
cd ..
```


## Upload distributable

Upload the distributable to an Amazon S3 bucket in your account. 

```
cd ./deployment
aws s3 cp ./global-s3-assets/ s3://$DIST_OUTPUT_BUCKET/$SOLUTION_NAME/$VERSION/ --recursive --acl bucket-owner-full-control
aws s3 cp ./regional-s3-assets/ s3://$DIST_OUTPUT_BUCKET-$REGION/$SOLUTION_NAME/$VERSION/ --recursive --acl bucket-owner-full-control
cd ..
```

_Note:_ you must have the AWS Command Line Interface installed.


## Deploy

Once you have uploaded the distributable to your Amazon S3 bucket, you can start the deployment.

- Deploy via CloudFormation

    Get the link of the solution template uploaded to your Amazon S3 bucket.

    Then you can deploy the solution to your account by launching a new AWS CloudFormation stack using the link of the solution template in Amazon S3.

- Deploy via CDK

    In case your accounts have not been bootstrapped for cdk yet, run:

    ```
    npx cdk bootstrap
    ```

    Then run:
    ```
    cd ./source/constructs
    npx cdk deploy centralized-logging-with-opensearch --parameters adminEmail=<your email address>
    ```
