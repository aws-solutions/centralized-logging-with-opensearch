# Customization

This solution is built using AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK). You can customize the solution by following the steps below.


## Prerequisites

Before you start customizing the solution, make sure you have the following prerequisites on your local machine:

- Python (>=3.9)
- NodeJS (v18 or later)
- Docker
> if you are using ARM CPU like Apple M1 chip, please run `export DOCKER_DEFAULT_PLATFORM=linux/amd64` for building amd64 container image.
-   Install Poetry. Below is one of the ways to install poetry. For other ways to install poetry, refer [Poetry installation instructions](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)

```shell
## Install pipx via pip
python3 -m pip install --user pipx
python3 -m pipx ensurepath

## OR Install pipx via brew
brew install pipx
pipx ensurepath

## Install poetry
pipx install poetry
pipx inject poetry poetry-plugin-export
```

Clone the repository and make desired code changes.

```
git clone aws-solutions/centralized-logging-with-opensearch
```


## File Structure

```

## Unit Test

After you have customized the solution. Run the unit tests to ensure the solution is working as expected. Review the generated coverage report.

```
cd ./deployment
chmod +x ./run-unit-tests.sh
./run-unit-tests.sh
cd ..
```

## Build

To build your customized distributable follow given steps.

- Configure the solution name, version number and bucket name

```
export DIST_OUTPUT_BUCKET=my-bucket-name # bucket where customized code will reside
export TEMPLATE_OUTPUT_BUCKET=my-bucket-name # same as DIST_OUTPUT_BUCKET
export SOLUTION_NAME=my-solution-name # e.g., centralized-logging-with-opensearch
export SOLUTION_TRADEMARKEDNAME=my-solution-name # same as SOLUTION_NAME (e.g., centralized-logging-with-opensearch)
export VERSION=my-version # version number for the customized code (e.g., v2.1.9)
export REGION=aws-region-code # the AWS region to launch the solution (e.g., us-east-1)
```

_Note:_ You would have to create an S3 bucket with the prefix 'my-bucket-name-<aws_region>'; aws_region is where you are testing the customized solution. Also, the assets in bucket should be publicly accessible.

- Build the distributable using build-s3-dist.sh

```
cd ./deployment
chmod +x ./build-s3-dist.sh
./build-s3-dist.sh $DIST_OUTPUT_BUCKET $SOLUTION_NAME $VERSION
cd ..
```


## Upload distributable

Upload the distributable to an Amazon S3 bucket in your account. 

```
cd ./deployment
aws s3 cp ./global-s3-assets/ s3://$DIST_OUTPUT_BUCKET/$SOLUTION_NAME/$VERSION/ --recursive --acl bucket-owner-full-control
aws s3 cp ./regional-s3-assets/ s3://$DIST_OUTPUT_BUCKET-$REGION/$SOLUTION_NAME/$VERSION/ --recursive --acl bucket-owner-full-control
cd ..
```

_Note:_ you must have the AWS Command Line Interface installed.


## Deploy

Once you have uploaded the distributable to your Amazon S3 bucket, you can start the deployment.

- Deploy via CloudFormation

    Get the link of the solution template uploaded to your Amazon S3 bucket.

    Then you can deploy the solution to your account by launching a new AWS CloudFormation stack using the link of the solution template in Amazon S3.
