This solution was designed with best practices from the [AWS Well-Architected Framework][well-architected-framework] which helps customers design and operate reliable, secure, efficient, and cost-effective workloads in the cloud.

This section describes how the design principles and best practices of the Well-Architected Framework were applied when building this solution.

## Operational excellence

This section describes how the principles and best practices of the [operational excellence pillar][operational-excellence-pillar] were applied when designing this solution.

The solution pushes metrics, logs and traces to Amazon CloudWatch at various stages to provide observability into the infrastructure, Elastic load balancer, Amazon ECS cluster, Lambda functions, Step Function workflow and the rest of the solution components. This solution also creates the CloudWatch dashboards for each pipeline monitoring.

## Security

This section describes how the principles and best practices of the [security pillar][security-pillar] were applied when designing this solution.

- The web console users are authenticated and authorized with Amazon Cognito or OpenID Connect.
- All inter-service communications use AWS IAM roles.
- All roles used by the solution follows least-privilege access. That is, it only contains minimum permissions required so the service can function properly.

## Reliability

This section describes how the principles and best practices of the [reliability pillar][reliability-pillar] were applied when designing this solution.

- Using AWS serverless services wherever possible (for example, AWS AppSync, Amazon DynamoDB, AWS Lambda, AWS Step Functions, Amazon S3, and Amazon SQS) to ensure high availability and recovery from service failure.
- Configuration management content of the solution is stored in Amazon DynamoDB, all of your data is stored on solid-state disks (SSDs) and is automatically replicated across multiple Availability Zones (AZs) in an AWS Region, providing built-in high availability and data durability.

## Performance efficiency

This section describes how the principles and best practices of the [performance efficiency pillar][performance-efficiency-pillar] were applied when designing this solution.

- The ability to launch this solution in any Region that supports AWS services in this solution such as: Amazon S3, Amazon ECS, Elastic load balancer.
- Using serverless architecture removes the need for you to run and maintain physical servers for traditional compute activities.
- Automatically testing and deploying this solution daily. Reviewing this solution by solution architects and subject matter experts for areas to experiment and improve.

## Cost optimization

This section describes how the principles and best practices of the [cost optimization pillar][cost-optimization-pillar] were applied when designing this solution.

- Use Autoscaling Group so that the compute costs are only related to how much data is ingested and processed.
- Using serverless services such as Amazon S3, Amazon DynamoDB, AWS Lambda, etc, so that customers only get charged for what they use.

## Sustainability

This section describes how the principles and best practices of the [sustainability pillar][sustainability-pillar] were applied when designing this solution.

- The solutionâ€˜s serverless design (using Amazon Kinesis Data Streams, Amazon S3, AWS Lambda) and the use of managed services (such as Amazon ECS) are aimed at reducing carbon footprint compared to the footprint of continually operating on-premises servers.
