By default, an Amazon OpenSearch Service domain within VPC cannot be accessed from the Internet. Centralized Logging with OpenSearch creates a highly available [Nginx cluster][nginx] which allows you to access the OpenSearch Dashboards from the Internet. Alternatively, you can choose to access the Amazon OpenSearch Service domains [using SSH Tunnel][ssh].

This section introduces the proxy stack architecture and how to complete the following:

1. [Create a proxy](#create-a-proxy)
2. [Create an associated DNS record](#create-an-associated-dns-record)
3. [Access Amazon OpenSearch Service via proxy](#access-amazon-opensearch-service-via-proxy)
4. [Delete a proxy](#delete-a-proxy)

## Architecture
Centralized Logging with OpenSearch creates an [Auto Scaling Group (ASG)][asg] together with an [Application Load Balancer (ALB)][alb].

![Proxy Stack Architecture](../../images/architecture/proxy.svg)

The workflow is as follows:

1. Users access the custom domain for the proxy, and the domain needs to be resolved via DNS service (for example, using Route 53 on AWS).

2. The DNS service routes the traffic to internet-facing ALB.

3. The ALB distributes traffic to backend Nginx server running on Amazon EC2 within ASG.

4. The Nginx server redirects the requests to OpenSearch Dashboards.

5. (optional) VPC peering is required if the VPC for the proxy is not the same as the OpenSearch service.

## Create a proxy
You can create the Nginx-based proxy using the Centralized Logging with OpenSearch console or by deploying a standalone CloudFormation stack.

**Prerequisites**

- Make sure an Amazon OpenSearch Service **domain** within VPC is available.
- The domain associated **SSL certificate** is created or uploaded in [Amazon Certificate Manager (ACM)][acm].
- Make sure you have the EC2 private key (.pem) file.

### Using the Centralized Logging with OpenSearch console
1. Log in to the Centralized Logging with OpenSearch console.
2. In the navigation pane, under **Domains**, choose **OpenSearch domains**.
3. Select the domain from the table.
4. Under **General configuration**, choose **Enable** at the **Access Proxy** label.

    !!! note "Note"

         Once the access proxy is enabled, a link to the access proxy will be available.

5. On the **Create access proxy** page, under **Public access proxy**, select at least 2 subnets for **Public Subnets**. You can choose 2 public subnets named `LogHubVPC/DefaultVPC/publicSubnet`, which are created by Centralized Logging with OpenSearch by default.
6. Choose a Security Group of the ALB in **Public Security Group**. You can choose a security group named `ProxySecurityGroup`, which is created by Centralized Logging with OpenSearch default.
7. Enter the **Domain Name**.
8. Choose **Load Balancer SSL Certificate** associated with the domain name.
9. Choose the **Nginx Instance Key Name**.
10. Choose **Create**.

### Using the CloudFormation stack
This automated AWS CloudFormation template deploys the *Centralized Logging with OpenSearch - Nginx access proxy* solution in the AWS Cloud.

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and select the button to launch the AWS CloudFormation template.

    [![Launch Stack](../../images/launch-stack.png)](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home#/stacks/new?templateURL=https://{{ bucket }}.s3.amazonaws.com/{{ solution }}/{{ version }}/NginxForOpenSearch.template){target=_blank}

    You can also [download the template](https://{{ bucket }}.s3.amazonaws.com/{{ solution }}/{{ version }}/NginxForOpenSearch.template) as a starting point for your own implementation.

2. To launch the stack in a different AWS Region, use the Region selector in the console navigation bar.

3. On the **Create stack** page, verify that the correct template URL shows in the **Amazon S3 URL** text box and choose **Next**.

4. On the **Specify stack details** page, assign a name to your stack.

5. Under **Parameters**, review the parameters for the template and modify them as necessary. This solution uses the following parameters.

    | Parameter  | Default          | Description                                                  |
    | ---------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
    | VPCId | `<Requires input>` | The VPC to deploy the Nginx proxy resources, for example, `vpc-bef13dc7`. |
    | PublicSubnetIds | `<Requires input>` | The public subnets where ELB are deployed. You need to select at least two public subnets, for example, `subnet-12345abc, subnet-54321cba`. |
    | ELBSecurityGroupId | `<Requires input>` | The Security group being associated with the ELB, for example, `sg-123456`. |
    | ELBDomain | `<Requires input>` | The custom domain name of the ELB, for example, `dashboard.example.com`. |
    | ELBDomainCertificateArn | `<Requires input>` | The SSL certificate ARN associated with the ELBDomain. The certificate must be created from [Amazon Certificate Manager (ACM)][acm]. |
    | PrivateSubnetIds | `<Requires input>` | The private subnets where Nginx instances are deployed. You need to select at least two private subnets, for example, `subnet-12345abc, subnet-54321cba`. |
    | NginxSecurityGroupId | `<Requires input>` | The Security group associated with the Nginx instances. The security group must allow access from ELB security group. |
    | KeyName | `<Requires input>` | The PEM key name of the Nginx instances. |
    | EngineType | OpenSearch | The engine type of the OpenSearch. Select OpenSearch or Elasticsearch. |
    | Endpoint | `<Requires input>` | The OpenSearch endpoint, for example, `vpc-your_opensearch_domain_name-xcvgw6uu2o6zafsiefxubwuohe.us-east-1.es.amazonaws.com`. |
    | CognitoEndpoint | `<Optional>` | The Cognito User Pool endpoint URL of the OpenSearch domain, for example, `mydomain.auth.us-east-1.amazoncognito.com`. Leave empty if your OpenSearch domain is not authenticated through Cognito User Pool. |

6. Choose **Next**.

7. On the **Configure stack options** page, choose **Next**.

8. On the **Review** page, review and confirm the settings. Check the box acknowledging that the template creates AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) resources.

9. Choose **Create** stack to deploy the stack.

You can view the status of the stack in the AWS CloudFormation console in the **Status** column. You should receive a **CREATE_COMPLETE** status in approximately 15 minutes.

### Recommended Proxy Configuration

The following table provides a list of recommended proxy configuration examples for different number of concurrent users. You can create proxy according to your own use cases.

| Number of Concurrent Users | Proxy Instance Type | Number of Proxy Instances |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------ |
| 4     | t3.nano                      | 1            |
| 6     | t3.micro                     | 1            |
| 8     | t3.nano                      | 2            |
| 10    | t3.small                     | 1            |
| 12    | t3.micro                     | 2            |
| 20    | t3.small                     | 2            |
| 25    | t3.large                     | 1            |
| 50+    | t3.large                     | 2            |

## Create an associated DNS record
After provisioning the proxy infrastructure, you need to create an associated DNS record in your DNS resolver. The following introduces how to find the ALB domain, and then create a CNAME record pointing to this domain.

1. Log in to the Centralized Logging with OpenSearch console.
2. In the navigation pane, under **Domains**, choose **OpenSearch domains**.
3. Select the domain from the table.
4. Choose the **Access Proxy** tab.
   You can see **Load Balancer Domain** which is the ALB domain.
5. Go to the DNS resolver, create a CNAME record pointing to this domain.
    If your domain is managed by [Amazon Route 53][route53], refer to [Creating records by using the Amazon Route 53 console][createrecords].

## Access Amazon OpenSearch Service via proxy
After the DNS record takes effect, you can access the Amazon OpenSearch Service built-in dashboard from anywhere via proxy. You can enter the domain of the proxy in your browser, or click the **Link** button under **Access Proxy** in the **General Configuration** section.

## Delete a Proxy
1. Log in to the Centralized Logging with OpenSearch console.
2. In the navigation pane, under **Domains**, choose **OpenSearch domains**.
3. Select the domain from the table.
4. Choose the **Access Proxy** tab.
5. Choose the **Delete**.
6. On the confirmation prompt, choose **Delete**.
