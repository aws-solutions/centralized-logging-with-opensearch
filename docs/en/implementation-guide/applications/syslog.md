# Syslog
Syslog is a standard for message logging, and is widely used to generate, forward and collect logs produced on a Linux instance, routers or network equipment. You can configure Centralized Logging with OpenSearch to ingest syslog logs.

!!! important "Important"

    Make sure your Syslog generator/sender's subnet is connected to Centralized Logging with OpenSearch' **two** private subnets so that logs can be ingested. You need to use VPC [Peering Connection][peering-connection] or [Transit Gateway][tgw] to connect these VPCs.

## Prerequisites
{%
include-markdown "include-prerequisites.md"
%}

## Step 1: Create a Syslog config

1. Sign in to the Centralized Logging with OpenSearch Console.
2. In the left sidebar, under **Resources**, choose **Log Config**.
3. Click the **Create a log config** button.
4. Specify **Config Name**.
6. Choose **Syslog** in the log type dropdown menu. Note that Centralized Logging with OpenSearch also supports Syslog with [JSON](./json.md) format and [single-line text](./single-line-text.md) format.

### RFC5424
1. Paste a sample RFC5424 log. For example:

    ```log
    <35>1 2013-10-11T22:14:15Z client_machine su - - - 'su root' failed for joe on /dev/pts/2
    ```

2. Choose **Parse Log**.

3. Check if each fields type mapping is correct. You can change the type by selecting the dropdown menu in the second column. For all supported types, see [Data Types](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/search-plugins/sql/datatypes/).

    !!! Note "Note"
        You must specify the datetime of the log using key “time”. If not specified, system time will be added.

4. Specify the **Time format**. The format syntax follows [strptime](https://linux.die.net/man/3/strptime). Check [this manual](https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/pipeline/parsers/configuring-parser#time-resolution-and-fractional-seconds) for details. For example:

    ```log
    %Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ
    ```

5. (Optional) In the **Filter** section, you add some conditions to filter logs at the log agent side. The solution will ingest logs that match ALL the specified conditions only.

6. Select **Create**.

### RFC3164
1. Paste a sample RFC3164 log. For example:

    ```log
    <35>Oct 12 22:14:15 client_machine su: 'su root' failed for joe on /dev/pts/2
    ```

2. Choose **Parse Log**.

3. Check if each fields type mapping is correct. You can change the type by selecting the dropdown menu in the second column. For all supported types, see [Data Types](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/search-plugins/sql/datatypes/).

    !!! Note "Note"
        You must specify the datetime of the log using key “time”. If not specified, system time will be added.

        Since there is no year in the timestamp of RFC3164, it cannot be displayed as a time histogram in the Discover interface of Amazon OpenSearch.

4. Specify the **Time format**. The format syntax follows [strptime](https://linux.die.net/man/3/strptime). Check [this](https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/pipeline/parsers/configuring-parser#time-resolution-and-fractional-seconds) for details. For example:

    ```log
    %b %m %H:%M:%S
    ```

5. (Optional) In the **Filter** section, you add some conditions to filter logs at the log agent side. The solution will ingest logs that match ALL the specified conditions only.

6. Select **Create**.

### Custom
1. In the **Syslog Format** section, paste your Syslog log format configuration. It is in the format of `/etc/rsyslog.conf` and starts with `template` or `$template`. The format syntax follows [Syslog Message Format](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5424?spm=a2c4g.11186623.0.0.21324a0fUixMd5#:~:text=2009%0A%0A%0A6.-,Syslog%20Message%20Format,-The%20syslog%20message).  For example:

    ```
    <%pri%>1 %timestamp:::date-rfc3339% %HOSTNAME% %app-name% %procid% %msgid% %msg%\n
    ```

2. In the **Sample log parsing** section, paste a sample Nginx log to verify if the log parsing is successful. For example:
    ```
    <35>1 2013-10-11T22:14:15.003Z client_machine su - - 'su root' failed for joe on /dev/pts/2
    ```

3. Check if each fields type mapping is correct. Change the type by selecting the dropdown menu in the second column. For all supported types, see [Data Types](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/search-plugins/sql/datatypes/). 

    !!! Note "Note"

        You must specify the datetime of the log using key “time”. If not specified, system time will be added.

4. Specify the **Time format**. The format syntax follows [strptime](https://linux.die.net/man/3/strptime). Check [this manual](https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/pipeline/parsers/configuring-parser#time-resolution-and-fractional-seconds) for details.

5. (Optional) In the **Filter** section, you add some conditions to filter logs at the log agent side. The solution will ingest logs that match ALL the specified conditions only.

6. Select **Create**.

## Step 2: Create an application log ingestion

{%
   include-markdown "create-log-ingestion.md"
   start="<!--syslog-start-->"
   end="<!--syslog-end-->"
%}

## Step 3: Configure the Syslog generator to send the logs to Centralized Logging with OpenSearch

1. Choose the Ingestion ID that has been created during **Step 2**.
2. For [Rsyslog][rsyslog] user, follow the Syslog Configuration Guide to configure the Rsyslog agent. You can also get the NLB DNS Name on this page.

## Step 4: View logs in OpenSearch

1. Open OpenSearch console in your browser.
2. Create an Index Pattern.
    {%
    include-markdown "../aws-services/include-index-pattern.md"
    %}
3. Go to **Discover** section in the left sidebar.
4. Change active index pattern to `<the application pipeline>-*`.
