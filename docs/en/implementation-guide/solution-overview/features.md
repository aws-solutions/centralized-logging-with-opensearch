The solution has the following features:

- **All-in-one log ingestion**: provides a single web console to ingest both application logs and AWS service logs into the Amazon OpenSearch Service domains. For supported AWS service logs, refer to [AWS Service Logs](../aws-services/index.md). For supported application logs, refer to [Application Logs](../applications/index.md).

- **Codeless log processor**: supports log processor plugins developed by AWS. You are allowed to enrich the raw log data through a few steps on the web console.

- **Out-of-the-box dashboard template**: offers a collection of reference designs of visualization templates, for both commonly used software such as Nginx and Apache HTTP Server, and AWS services such as Amazon S3 and Amazon CloudTrail.
