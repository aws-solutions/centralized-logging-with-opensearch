# Getting Started

After [deploying the solution](../deployment/index.md), refer to this section to quickly learn how to leverage Centralized Logging with OpenSearch for log ingestion (AWS CloudTrail logs as an example), and log visualization. 

You can also choose to start with [Domain management](../domains/index.md) , then build [AWS Service Log Analytics Pipelines](../aws-services/index.md) and [Application Log Analytics Pipelines](../applications/index.md).

## Steps 

- [Step 1: Import an Amazon OpenSearch Service domain](./1.import-domain.md). Import an existing Amazon OpenSearch Service domain into the solution.
- [Step 2: Create Access Proxy](./2.create-proxy.md). Create a public access proxy which allows you to access the templated dashboard from anywhere.
- [Step 3: Ingest CloudTrail Logs](./3.build-cloudtrail-pipeline.md). Ingest CloudTrail logs into the specified Amazon OpenSearch Service domain.
- [Step 4: Access built-in dashboard](./4.view-dashboard.md). View the dashboard of CloudTrail logs.
