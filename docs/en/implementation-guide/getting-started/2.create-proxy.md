# Step 2: Create Access Proxy

!!! note "Note"

    Access proxy is optional and it incurs additional cost. If you can connect to Amazon OpenSearch's VPC (such as through VPN connection), you don't need to activate access proxy. You need to use it only if you want to connect to Amazon OpenSearch dashboard from public Internet. 

You can create a Nginx proxy and create an DNS record pointing to the proxy, so that you can access the Amazon OpenSearch Service dashboard securely from public network. For more information, refer to [Access Proxy](../domains/proxy.md) in the Domain Management chapter.

## Create a Nginx proxy

1. Sign in to the Centralized Logging with OpenSearch console.
2. In the navigation pane, under **Domains**, choose **OpenSearch domains**.
3. Select the domain from the table.
4. Under **General configuration**, choose **Enable** at the **Access Proxy** label.
5. On the **Create access proxy** page, under **Public access proxy**, select at least 2 subnets which contain `LogHubVpc/DefaultVPC/publicSubnetX` for the **Public Subnets**.
6. For **Public Security Group**, choose the Security Group which contains `ProxySecurityGroup`.
7. Enter the **Domain Name**.
8. Choose the associated **Load Balancer SSL Certificate** which applies to the domain name.
9. Choose the **Nginx Instance Key Name**.

10. Choose **Create**.

After provisioning the proxy infrastructure, you need to create an associated DNS record in your DNS resolver. The following introduces how to find the Application Load Balancing (ALB) domain, and then create a CNAME record pointing to this domain.

## Create an DNS record

1. Sign in to the Centralized Logging with OpenSearch console.
2. In the navigation pane, under **Domains**, choose **OpenSearch domains**.
3. Select the domain from the table.
4. Choose the **Access Proxy** tab. Find **Load Balancer Domain**, which is the ALB domain.
5. Go to the DNS resolver, and create a CNAME record pointing to this domain. If your domain is managed by [Amazon Route 53][route53], refer to [Creating records by using the Amazon Route 53 console][createrecords].
