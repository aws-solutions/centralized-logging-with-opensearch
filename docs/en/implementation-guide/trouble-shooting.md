# Troubleshooting

The following help you to fix errors or problems that you might encounter when using Centralized Logging with OpenSearch.

## Error: Failed to assume service-linked role `arn:x:x:x:/AWSServiceRoleForAppSync`

The reason for this error is that the account has never used the [AWS AppSync](https://aws.amazon.com/appsync/) service. You can deploy the solution's CloudFormation template again. AWS has already created the role automatically when you encountered the error.

You can also go to [AWS CloudShell](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudshell/) or the local terminal and run the following AWS CLI command to Link AppSync Role

```
aws iam create-service-linked-role --aws-service-name appsync.amazonaws.com
```

## Error: Unable to add backend role

Centralized Logging with OpenSearch only supports Amazon OpenSearch Service domain with [Fine-grained access control](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/fgac.html) enabled.
You need to go to Amazon OpenSearch Service console, and edit the **Access policy** for the Amazon OpenSearch Service domain.

## Errorï¼šUser xxx is not authorized to perform sts:AssumeRole on resource

![](../images/faq/assume-role-latency.png)

If you see this error, please make sure you have entered the correct information during [cross account setup](./link-account/index.md), and then please wait for several minutes.

Centralized Logging with OpenSearch uses [AssumeRole](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_AssumeRole.html) for cross-account access.
This is the best practice to temporary access the AWS resources in your member account.
However, these roles created during [cross account setup](./link-account/index.md) take seconds or minutes to be affective.


## Error: PutRecords API responded with error='InvalidSignatureException'

Fluent-bit agent reports PutRecords API responded with error='InvalidSignatureException', message='The request signature we calculated does not match the signature you provided. Check your AWS Secret Access Key and signing method. Consult the service documentation for details.'

Please restart the fluent-bit agent. For example, on EC2 with Amazon Linux2, run command:
```commandline
sudo service fluent-bit restart
```

## Error: PutRecords API responded with error='AccessDeniedException'

Fluent-bit agent deployed on EKS Cluster reports "AccessDeniedException" when sending records to Kinesis. Verify that
the IAM role trust relations are correctly set. With the Centralized Logging with OpenSearch console:

1. Open the Centralized Logging with OpenSearch console.
2. In the left sidebar, under **Log Source**, choose **EKS Clusters**.
3. Choose the **EKS Cluster** that you want to check.
4. Click the **IAM Role ARN** which will open the IAM Role in AWS Console.
5. Choose the **Trust relationships** to verify that the OIDC Provider, the service account namespace and conditions are correctly set.

You can get more information from Amazon EKS [IAM role configuration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/iam-roles-for-service-accounts-technical-overview.html#iam-role-configuration)

## My CloudFormation stack is stuck on deleting an `AWS::Lambda::Function` resource when I update the stack. How to resolve it?
![](../images/faq/cloudformation-stuck.png)
The Lambda function resides in a VPC, and you need to wait for the associated ENI resource to be deleted.


## The agent status is offline after I restart the EC2 instance, how can I make it auto start on instance restart?

This usually happens if you have installed the log agent, but restart the instance before you create any Log Ingestion. The log agent will auto restart if there is at least one Log Ingestion. If you have a log ingestion, but the problem still exists, you can use `systemctl status fluent-bit`
to check its status inside the instance.

## I have switched to Global tenant. However, I still cannot find the dashboard in OpenSearch.

This is usually because Centralized Logging with OpenSearch received 403 error from OpenSearch when creating the index template and dashboard. This
can be fixed by re-run the Lambda function manually by following the steps below:

With the Centralized Logging with OpenSearch console:

1. Open the Centralized Logging with OpenSearch console, and find the AWS Service Log pipeline which has this issue.
2. Copy the first 5 characters from the ID section. E.g. you should copy `c169c` from ID `c169cb23-88f3-4a7e-90d7-4ab4bc18982c`
3. Go to AWS Console > Lambda. Paste in function filters. This will filter in all the lambda function created for this AWS Service Log ingestion.
4. Click the Lambda function whose name contains "OpenSearchHelperFn".
5. In the **Test** tab, create a new event with any Event name.
6. Click the **Test** button to trigger the Lambda, and wait the lambda function to complete.
7. The dashboard should be available in OpenSearch.

## Error from Fluent-bit agent: ```version `GLIBC_2.25' not found ```
This error is caused by old version of ```glibc```. Centralized Logging with OpenSearch with version later than 1.2 requires glibc-2.25 or above. So you must upgrade the existing version in EC2 first.
The upgrade command for different kinds of OS is shown as follows:

!!! important "Important"
    We strongly recommend you run the commands with environments first. Any upgrade failure may cause severe loss.

#### Redhat 7.9

For Redhat 7.9, the whole process will take about 2 hours,and at least 10 GB storage is needed.
