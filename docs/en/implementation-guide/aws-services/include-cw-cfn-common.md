1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and select the button to launch the AWS CloudFormation template. You can also download the template as a starting point for your own implementation.

2. To launch the Centralized Logging with OpenSearch in a different AWS Region, use the Region selector in the console navigation bar.

3. On the **Create stack** page, verify that the correct template URL shows in the **Amazon S3 URL** text box and choose **Next**.

4. On the **Specify stack details** page, assign a name to your solution stack.

5. Under **Parameters**, review the parameters for the template and modify them as necessary. This solution uses the following parameters.
