# Amazon S3 Logs
[Amazon S3 server access logging](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/ServerLogs.html) provides detailed records for the requests made to the bucket. S3 access logs can be enabled and saved in another S3 bucket.
## Create log ingestion
You can create a log ingestion into Amazon OpenSearch Service either by using the Centralized Logging with OpenSearch console or by deploying a standalone CloudFormation stack.

!!! important "Important"
    - The S3 Bucket region must be the same as the Centralized Logging with OpenSearch solution region.
    - The Amazon OpenSearch Service index is rotated on a daily basis by default, and you can adjust the index in the Additional Settings.
### Using the Centralized Logging with OpenSearch Console
1. Sign in to the Centralized Logging with OpenSearch Console.
2. In the navigation pane, under **Log Analytics Pipelines**, choose **Service Log**.
3. Choose the **Create a log ingestion** button.
4. In the **AWS Services** section, choose **Amazon S3**.
5. Choose **Next**.
6. Under **Specify settings**, choose **Automatic** or **Manual** for **S3 Access Log enabling**. The automatic mode will enable the S3 Access Log and save the logs to a centralized S3 bucket if logging is not enabled yet.
    - For **Automatic mode**, choose the S3 bucket from the dropdown list.
    - For **Manual mode**, enter the **Bucket Name** and **S3 Access Log location**.
    - (Optional) If you are ingesting Amazon S3 logs from another account, select a [linked account](../link-account/index.md) from the **Account** dropdown list first.
7. Choose **Next**.
8. In the **Specify OpenSearch domain** section, select an imported domain for **Amazon OpenSearch domain**.
9. Choose **Yes** for **Sample dashboard** if you want to ingest an associated built-in Amazon OpenSearch Service dashboard.
10. You can change the **Index Prefix** of the target Amazon OpenSearch Service index if needed. The default prefix is your bucket name.
11. In the **Log Lifecycle** section, enter the number of days to manage the Amazon OpenSearch Service index lifecycle. The Centralized Logging with OpenSearch will create the associated [Index State Management (ISM)](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/im-plugin/ism/index/) policy automatically for this pipeline.
12. Choose **Next**.
13. Add tags if needed.
14. Choose **Create**.
